### Authentication

Before you can start using the commands above, you need to complete a quick
registration. If you're a brand new user, you'll generally only need `.init`.


| Command | Argument(s) | Description | Example |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `.init` | | Initialize as a new user. You should not use this command more than once, even if you're on a different platform than the one you first initialized on. | `.init` |
| `.secret` | | Get your unique secret, required for registering on other platforms. | `.secret` |
| `.register` | `secret` | Register on a new platform, provided that you've initialized  elsewhere. | `.register 1234567890` |

**Note**: On Discord, authentication is done via PM with the bot; these
commands won't work in public channels.
